# Flightz_recommended_recipe
There is no doubt that every engineer, programmer, and developer is always learning or coding. That’s why I wanted to make a recipe that was not only delicious but also super quick and easy to make. So I'm going to rank the dishes based on `ease and speed` of cooking.   
毫無疑問，每個工程師、程式設計師和開發人員總是在學習或coding。這就是為什麼我想做一個不僅美味而且超級快速且易於製作的食譜。所以我將根據`烹飪的難易度和速度`對菜餚進行排序。
